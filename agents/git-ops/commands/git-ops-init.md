description: Check git/GitHub environment readiness and optionally set up defaults
agent: git-ops

Run the git-ops-init tool to verify the environment is properly configured
for git and GitHub operations. Report the full results.

If any issues are found, explain how to fix them.

If no labels or milestones exist, ask the user if they'd like to create
default labels (bug, feature, chore, priority:high/medium/low,
status:in-progress/blocked) and/or an initial milestone using the setup tool.
