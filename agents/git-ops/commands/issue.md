$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments are provided, list all open issues.

If arguments describe a bug, feature, or task, create a new issue with:
- An appropriate title derived from the description
- A well-structured markdown body
- Suggested labels based on the content (bug, feature, chore, and priority level)
- Association with a milestone if the user mentions one

If arguments reference an issue number (e.g., "#42" or just "42"), view that issue.

If arguments say to close, update, or comment on an issue, do that.
