$ARGUMENTS

If no arguments are provided:
1. Ask the user what topic or problem they want to brainstorm about.
2. Ask who the target audience is (roles, experience level, context).
3. Run a free-form ideation session using the perspective lenses.
4. Present ideas as a numbered list with audience impact noted for each.
5. Offer to deep-dive on any idea or delegate to @git-ops to create issues.

If arguments provide a topic but no audience:
1. Ask who the target audience is before generating ideas.
2. Once the audience is clear, diverge with 6-8 ideas across multiple angles.
3. Highlight which perspective lens each idea comes from.
4. Offer to score, rank, or expand on any ideas.

If arguments include both a topic and audience context:
1. Skip clarification and start diverging immediately.
2. Generate 8-12 ideas across at least 3 perspective lenses.
3. Flag any radical ideas with the three-part protocol (insight, risk, experiment).
4. Offer to evaluate and rank ideas, or delegate winners to @git-ops as issues.

After any session, ask the user if they want to:
- Go deeper on specific ideas
- Run a full structured /brainstorm session
- Create GitHub issues for actionable ideas (delegate to @git-ops)
